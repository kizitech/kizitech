<b>👋🏽 Hey there, I’m Kizito!</b>
<br >
I’m a software developer who loves building things that actually make people’s lives easier. I got into tech out of pure curiosity — and that curiosity turned into a passion for creating clean, useful, and beautiful web apps.

### What’s Next for Me 🚀
- After recognizing the limitations of focusing solely on frontend development in a team setting, I’m leveling up to full-stack development.
- My goal? To become the kind of developer people trust, enjoy working with, and can rely on for real values.
- And no matter how busy life gets, I always want to find time to keep learning something new.
